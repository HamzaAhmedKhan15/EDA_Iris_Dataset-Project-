## Iris Flower Classification

In this script, we start by loading the Iris dataset and meticulously checking for any missing values. We then explore the distribution of the target variable, 'species,' and provide an in-depth understanding of the dataset through descriptive statistics and pairplot visualizations.

I've employed various powerful machine learning algorithms to gain insights into the data:

üîç Logistic Regression: This algorithm was utilized to uncover intricate patterns and associations within the dataset. It allowed us to gain crucial insights into the factors influencing a student's academic journey.

üå≥ Decision Tree: Another model in our arsenal was the Decision Tree, which helped us visualize the decision-making process behind a student's path. This approach shed light on the most critical predictors in the context of the data.

Next, we split it into features (X) and the target (Y) for machine learning. Next, we build and train our models. First up is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model (SVC) for accuracy assessment on test data. We also use LabelEncoder to convert 'species' into numbers.

Then, we train a Logistic Regression model, evaluate accuracy, and produce detailed classification reports and confusion matrices. This approach offers a comprehensive performance evaluation and valuable insights from the Iris dataset.
